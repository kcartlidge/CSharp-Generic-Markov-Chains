# C# Markov Chains (Generic)
Simple pattern 'learning' with Markov chains. After repeated 'repeatable' events, is able to generate more of those repeatable events that follow a similar frequency pattern. Useful for things like generating English-looking random text or making the best chess move after training across chess game histories.
